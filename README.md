# CBLBs: Configurable (Bio)Logic Blocks

This repository is supplementing the paper Field-programmable biological circuits and configurable (bio)logic blocks for distributed biological computing [1]. 

## Folders
The project is organized in the following folders
* [```cblb```](/cblb/): deterministic and stochastic models of a CBLB and its modules.
* [```robustness```](/robustness/): analysis of robustness.
* [```latch```](/latch/): model of a multicellular latch, i.e. toggle switch, as described in [2].
* [```mux```](/mux/): model of a multicellular multiplexer and derivation of its kinetic parameters using the transfer-function models and values from [3].


## Main files
The main files that can be used to reproduce the results reported in the paper [1] are as follows
* [```cblb/models.py```](/cblb/models.py): the implementation of deterministic and stochastic models.
* [```cblb/run_ode_model_clb.py```](/cblb/run_ode_model_clb.py): deterministic simulation of a CBLB.
* [```cblb/run_ssa_model_clb.py```](/cblb/run_ssa_model_clb.py): stochastic simulation of a CBLB.
* [```cblb/run_ODE_AND_OR_NOT.py```](/cblb/run_ODE_AND_OR_NOT.py): deterministic simulation of a CBLB configured as AND, OR and NOT gate.
* [```robustness/run_solver.py```](/robustness/run_solver.py): perform the exploration of viable parameter space as described in [4].
* [```robustness/run_solver_population.py```](/robustness/run_solver_population.py): perform the exploration of viable parameter space [4] investigating also viable population ratios.
* [```robustness/robustness_analysis.py```](/robustness/robustness_analysis.py): visualize and analyse the results of the obtained viable parameter space.
* [```robustness/robustness_analysis_population.py```](/robustness/robustness_analysis_population.py): visualize the results of the analysis of different population ratio effects.
